## Prerequisites to run functional tests
The functional tests use the Firefox web browser and Geckodriver.

The Geckodriver is available from:

	 https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases.

You should download and extract it and put it somewhere on your system path,
for example, /usr/local/bin if running Linux.
